! This is config for xmodmap: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap
! What it does:
! 1. disable caps lock;
! 2. maps to CapsLock button (code 66) control action;
! 3. maps to Ctrl button (code 37) escape action.
! Notes:
! 1. "keycode" commands should be before "add control";
!    If I understood right, "Control_L" and "Escape" are labels (keysyms) for keycodes,
!    "add control" finds keycodes with labels listed on right side of this command
!    and assigns them to "control" modifier key.
! 2. to find keycode of a button run `xev` command;
! 3. useful flags for xmodmap are -pm and -pke.
